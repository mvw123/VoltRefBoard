Voltage Calibration Board
=========================

Reference board for voltage calibration. 
Design files are in Eagle v 6.5.0 (free version).
The design is 5cm x 5cm to allow low cost manufacture. 

CAD A - [PCB ordered]
=====================

PCB fabrication ordered from OSH park. 
Need to setup parts for ordering. 
2.5v and 5.0v voltage reference source from a 9v battery or from an external power source.
The use of >10V is slightly more accurate when using these precision reference ICs.
